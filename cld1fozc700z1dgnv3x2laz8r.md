# Effects you can build with CSS without JavaScript

An interactive website is always a good choice. Animating a website is a great way to grab users' attention and make them feel more comfortable. As a web developer, you can create many cool effects, transitions, and animations with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In this article, we will briefly go over some effects and transitions you can build without

## 1\. Animated submit button

Users enjoy the little surprises that clever web designers like to weave across their pages. In addition to providing visual confirmation that an action has been completed, this animation button is also a neat, appealing way of doing so.

## 2\. Coffee machine

Consider building a coffee maker entirely from HTML and CSS. It may seem unachievable, but it's not. This coffee maker periodically pours coffee into a mug. The coffee in the cup also produces steam, indicating that it is hot.

## 3\. Three dots loading

Using only HTML and CSS, the three loading dots make for spectacular animations. For instance, this animation could be shown to users while they wait for a page to load.

## 4\. Minimal cat

This animation example skillfully illustrates the power of the transform property in CSS. This cat blinks intermittently as it scans its surroundings.

## 5\. Snow globe

I'm reminded of the holiday season by this animation. A typical residence is situated inside a glass globe as it snows.
