# Android Development 101: 10 Key Tips for Getting Started with Android Development

Interested in building Android applications but have no idea where to begin? You’re in the right place.

The process of becoming an Android developer is easy, but it is much more difficult to become an excellent Android developer who stands out. To succeed, you need to work hard, be consistent, and be patient.

In this article, we will go over ten essential tips you need to become an excellent Android developer. These Android development tips will give you a head start.

Let’s get started!

## **1\. Make sure your system meets the requirements for building Android apps and running an emulator.**

A coursemate installed Android Studio and an emulator on his laptop that just could not possibly handle Android Studio. We, his classmates, had warned him initially but his exact response was “What’s all the fuss about? How bad can it possibly be?”

*Okay, Daniel.*

As he ran the code, his laptop hung, and let’s just say he came to school with a new laptop the following week.

Having a system that meets the requirements for building Android apps is crucial. This is because failure to meet these requirements results in the following:

* Your system may experience crashes while running Android development tools
    
* The Android emulator may run very slowly or not at all
    
* Your system may overheat.
    
* Your IDE may take a longer time than expected to open.
    
* The Android app you are building may not run properly on your device or emulator.
    

Your device should meet the following requirements:

* Intel Core i5 or i7 processor (minimum).
    
* 12 GB of RAM is usually recommended, but Google recommends 64 GB.
    
* Operating System: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
* At least 256 GB of laptop storage. At least 30GB of free space is needed to start. Note that the more you build, the more free space is required.
    

Note, if you don’t want to install an emulator on your system, it’s advisable to use an Android device.

Ensure your system meets the requirements listed so that you can build Android apps smoothly.

*Don’t be like Daniel.*

## **2\. Familiarize yourself with Java and Kotlin.**

On 7 May 2019, Google announced that Kotlin is its preferred language for Android development. If you are an absolute beginner with no prior knowledge of Java or Kotlin, it is advisable to learn Kotlin for Android development.

Check out my tweet.

Advantages of building Android applications with Kotlin include:

* Kotlin is much easier to use and learn than Java.
    
* Kotlin can cross-compile and run on multiple platforms.
    
* With Kotlin, you write less code to achieve the same result.
    
* Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java. This means that you can use Java libraries and frameworks for your Kotlin code and vice versa.
    
* Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines which can simplify asynchronous programming and make it easier to write asynchronous code.
    

That is not to say that you cannot and should not build Android apps with Java. I use Java for Android development as I have been proficient in Java before starting Android development.

Overall, Kotlin makes Android development more efficient and less error-prone, while providing a more modern, language that is easier to read and maintain.

## **3\. Develop with the smallest device in mind.**

When building Android applications, it is fitting to develop with the smallest device in mind. Remember that not all devices have the same screen size or processing power. If you design an application with a large screen or huge processing power requirements, it may not work well or even at all on a smaller or less powerful device.

Additionally, building with the smallest device in mind improves the user’s experience and satisfaction with your application. As a result, all users can use your app without any issues.

## **4\. Understand the Android application lifecycle.**

The Android lifecycle is the series of events that an Android app goes through from the moment it is launched until it is closed by the user or the system. The Android lifecycle includes not only the lifecycle of an activity but also the lifecycle of other app components, such as services and broadcast receivers.

An activity has six states:

* Created
    
* Started
    
* Resumed
    
* Paused
    
* Stopped
    
* Destroyed
    

There are seven main methods associated with the Android Activity lifecycle:

* onCreate(): It is called when the activity is first created.
    
* onStart(): It is called when the activity is becoming visible to the user.
    
* onResume(): It is called just before the activity starts interacting with the user.
    
* onPause(): It is called when the activity goes in the background (i.e. not visible to the user).
    
* onStop(): It is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
    
* onRestart(): It is called when the activity is started again from the stopped state.
    
* onDestroy(): It is called when the activity is about to be destroyed. This is the final lifecycle method.
    

It is imperative to understand the Android lifecycle. Developers can ensure that users have a seamless user experience by managing resources like memory and network connections properly.

## **5\. Create a responsive user interface.**

It is imperative to create a responsive UI. This ensures that your app can run on all devices, regardless of their screen sizes and orientations. This will enhance the user’s experience and make your app accessible.

## **6\. Test your app on multiple devices and emulators.**

When running your Android app, test it on different emulators and devices. Various Android devices come in a variety of sizes, resolutions, and hardware configurations.

Additionally, testing on different devices and emulators allows you to detect any potential issues that may arise. This is specific for identifying hardware-specific issues that may not be apparent on other devices.

A multi-device testing process ensures that your app is compatible across a wide range of devices. In this way, users can be sure that their applications are flawless.

## **7\. Android Studio &gt; Eclipse**

For Android development, Android Studio has generally been considered a better IDE than Eclipse. Not only does Android Studio offer a more efficient experience for creating Android apps, but it also:

* Designed specifically for Android development, while Eclipse requires additional plugins to work well with Android.
    
* Has better support for Gradle.
    
* Offers better support for debugging and testing Android apps.
    
    With this in mind, use Android Studio as your IDE.
    

## 8\. **Implement the MVC design pattern for your projects.**

It is advisable to implement a design pattern such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for project structure.

The Model represents the logic, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller handles the user input. The Controller also updates the Model and View accordingly.

This helps us separate our concerns between the different components of an application. Additionally, it makes our code more maintainable, testable, and reusable.

## **9\. Master the use of data structures like arrays and lists.**

When building Android apps, we are required to use data structures often. They are the building blocks of organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Mastering data structures in Java or Kotlin can lead to more efficient code and improved problem-solving skills when building Android apps.

## **10\. Stay up to date with the latest developments in Android (such as APIs, SDK versions, and libraries).**

I made the mistake of trying to learn Android from an Android tutorial that was almost six years old! I tried using the same dependencies as he did and it was nothing but a pool of errors.

It was later I realized that most things in the tutorial were outdated.

Staying up to date with the latest development in Android is crucial for Android developers. It helps developers remain competitive and build cutting-edge apps that meet the needs of the modern user.

## **Summary**
